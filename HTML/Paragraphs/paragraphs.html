<body>
    <h1>Main Title</h1>
    
    <p>This is the first paragraph of the webpage. Paragraphs allow you to divide text content into manageable chunks, improving readability.</p>
    
    <p>This is the second paragraph. The browser automatically adds some space between this paragraph and the one above it, creating a clean layout.</p>
    
    <p>Each paragraph starts on a new line and extends across the page unless styled differently using CSS.</p>
</body>
