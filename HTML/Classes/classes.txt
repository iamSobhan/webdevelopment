In HTML, classes allow us to apply CSS styles to multiple elements at once. 
Classes are defined in HTML using the class attribute, which can be applied to any HTML element. 
They are often used for styling and can be reused across multiple elements for consistent design.

<p class="highlight">This is highlighted text.</p>

Classes are defined in CSS by prefixing the class name with a period (.).
.highlight {
  color: blue;
  font-weight: bold;
}
