The HTML <div> element is a block-level container used to group other elements together. 
It doesn't have any inherent visual representation but serves as a structure to organize content on a webpage. 
The <div> tag is often used with CSS or JavaScript to apply styles, layouts, or interactivity to sections of the page.
