The HTML <div> element is a block-level container used to group other elements together. 
It doesn't have any inherent visual representation but serves as a structure to organize content on a webpage. 
The <div> tag is often used with CSS or JavaScript to apply styles, layouts, or interactivity to sections of the page.

As a Container for Grouping Elements: The <div> element can group multiple HTML elements, making it easier to apply styles or manage layout to a particular section of the webpage.
Example:
<div>
  <h1>This is a heading</h1>
  <p>This is a paragraph inside a div.</p>
</div>
