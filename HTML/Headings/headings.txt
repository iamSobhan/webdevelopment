1. <h1> - Main Heading (Most Important)
     The <h1> tag is typically used for the main title of the page or the most important heading. 
     There should ideally be only one <h1> on a web page to represent the primary topic.
     Example:
     <h1>This is the Main Heading</h1> 

2. <h2> - Subheading
   The <h2> tag is used for subheadings that are secondary to the main heading. 
   It's often used to divide sections of content under the main title.
   Example:
   <h2>This is a Subheading</h2>

3. <h3> - Sub-subheading
   The <h3> tag represents a sub-subheading, typically used to further break down sections under an <h2> heading.
   Example:
   <h3>This is a Sub-subheading</h3>

4. <h4> to <h6> - Lower-level Headings
   The <h4>, <h5>, and <h6> tags are used for headings with decreasing importance. 
   These are rarely used unless thereâ€™s a need for more detailed structuring, such as subcategories or lower-level sections within a document.
   Example:
   <h4>This is a Heading 4</h4>
   <h5>This is a Heading 5</h5>
   <h6>This is a Heading 6</h6>
