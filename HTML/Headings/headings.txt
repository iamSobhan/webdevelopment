HTML headings are used to define titles and subtitles on a web page, helping to structure content and improve readability. There are six levels of headings, from <h1> to <h6>, with <h1> being the highest (most important) level and <h6> the lowest (least important). These headings are essential for both visual presentation and SEO, as they help search engines understand the hierarchy and structure of content.
