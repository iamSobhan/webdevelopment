In HTML, the <img> tag is used to embed images in a webpage. 
Unlike other HTML elements, the <img> tag is self-closing and does not have a closing tag. 
The image itself is not directly embedded; instead, the <img> tag refers to an image file, typically hosted on the web server or on an external source.

Basic Syntax
<img src="URL" alt="description" />

src (source): The URL or file path of the image.
alt (alternative text): A short description of the image, displayed if the image fails to load or for screen readers.
