In HTML, the <img> tag is used to embed images in a webpage. 
Unlike other HTML elements, the <img> tag is self-closing and does not have a closing tag. 
The image itself is not directly embedded; instead, the <img> tag refers to an image file, typically hosted on the web server or on an external source.

Basic Syntax
<img src="URL" alt="description" />

src (source): The URL or file path of the image.
alt (alternative text): A short description of the image, displayed if the image fails to load or for screen readers.

Key Attributes of the <img> Tag

1. src (Required)
Defines the path to the image file.
Can be a relative path (on the same server) or an absolute path (external URL).

Example:
<img src="images/photo.jpg" alt="A beautiful photo" />

2. alt (Required)
Provides alternative text for the image. This is displayed if the image cannot be loaded and is used by screen readers for accessibility purposes.

Example:
<img src="broken-image.jpg" alt="A description of the image" />
