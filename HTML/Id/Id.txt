In HTML, the id attribute is used to uniquely identify an HTML element on a webpage. 
Unlike classes, which can be applied to multiple elements, each id must be unique within a page. 
The id is commonly used for CSS styling, JavaScript manipulation, and linking to specific sections within a page.

<p id="introduction">This paragraph has a unique ID.</p>
